I've tailored each strategy specifically for the Tradier Brokerage API

STRATEGIES:
1. Gamma Scalping //
Gamma scalping is a strategy used by options traders to manage the risk of their portfolio and capitalize on the volatility of the underlying asset. The idea is to adjust the delta of an option portfolio to zero by buying or selling shares of the underlying asset as the market moves. This strategy profits from the changes in the underlying price, as the adjustments made help in capturing the difference between the realized volatility and the implied volatility priced into the options.
   
2. Illiquid Market Making //
Illiquid Market Making involves providing liquidity in markets where it is scarce, typically in options or stocks that are not frequently traded. Traders use this strategy to earn the spread between the bid and ask prices by fulfilling buy and sell orders in these illiquid markets. The key here is to manage the inventory risk effectively and to price the illiquid options accurately to capture the spread without taking on excessive risk.
   
3. Variance Premium //
The Variance Premium trading strategy involves taking a position based on the difference between the implied variance (IV) of     options and the realized variance (RV) of the underlying asset. Traders aim to profit from the variance risk premium â€“ the         tendency of IV to be higher than RV over time. A common approach is selling options to collect the premium, betting that the       realized volatility of the underlying will be less than what the market expects.
